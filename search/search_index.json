Later on, you might waste time trying to re-oragnise data or lose parts of it altogether. Poorly managed data is especially risky if your data is sensitive and needs to be kept secure. Poorly managed data is also harder for others to find, understand, and trust. That means fewer people will use or cite your work, which can limit its impact. In the long run, this could affect your chances of getting future funding or support.  **Other researchers**<p></p> If a research project isn\u2019t well managed, other people will struggle to understand the data or figure out if it\u2019s useful for their own work. Missing information and unclear research processes make the data harder to trust and use. As a result, valuable data might be overlooked, and researchers could end up repeating work that\u2019s already been done as they can't find existing data or make sense of it.  **Research as a whole**<p></p> If research data is managed well, a single dataset can be used by mutliple researchers to support a variety of research purposes. This saves time and resources in collecting data. However, if research data is poorly managed, data can't be easily re-used, meaning more time and money will be spent creating similar datasets.    <p>[!NOTE] :large_blue_diamond: KR Which structure should we keep for impacts of poor data management?

A **metadata element** is the container that describes what information the metadata is covering. It could be described as the title or the label for the metadata. (e.g. 'Title', 'Alternate Title', 'Publisher', 'Date').

The research lifecycle is often concieved as a circle. Why do you think that is? </p> <p></p> Research data lifecycle: a circle <p></p>   By placing the research lifecycle stages in a circle, we highlight the idea that research is an ever evolving process. Data, and the documentation around that data, can be updated or added to. As research processes are complex, you may go through the lifecycle stages multiple times in a single project.   Data has the potential to serve many research activities beyond the original study. With good data practices, existing data can lead to new research questions, secondary research and cross-study comparisons, enabling the lifecycle to start again.   Which stage includes metadata? <p></p>   All of them! Metadata is a vital tool throughout research lifecycle. Having strong metadata helps people outside a project who are engaging with research data (metadata users), as well as researchers and data managers within a project who are managing data (metadata creators).   With that in mind, the creation, management, and use of metadata should be integrated in all areas of the research lifecycle.   <p>[!NOTE] KR Other lifecycles UKDS: Data lifecycle which has a corresponding training video here.

However, thinking about the research activities above, how might you use metadata from other research projects to help you conduct a literature review or identify datasets that you could use in secondary research?</p> Ways we can use metadata to help us in the design phase <p></p>   **Metadata can help us discover research**  When robust metadata is available, you can search data repositories such [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/) or metadata catalogues such as [CLOSER Discovery](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=www.closer.ac.uk&amp;utm_campaign=Menu%20-%20search%20our%20data%20) to discover datasets effecitvely. It's the project's metadata which enable the filter and search functions of these sites.   **Metadata can help us understand what a research project is about**  When you want to look into a dataset more closely, metadata helps you quickly understand what the data is about and how the research was conducted. It provides information on who produced the data and how the research was funded.  **Metadata can tell us how to access data**  Metadata lets you know how to access data and who to contact if you have further questions around the research project."},{"location":"introduction/2.3%20Metadata%20in%20the%20research%20lifecycle/#creating-metadata-in-the-research-lifecycle","title":"Creating metadata in the research lifecycle","text":"<p>Next, let's look at how creating metadata can help the research lifecycle.</p> <p>Research can be a disconnected process. Information about data or research activities can be lost at different stages or stored in silos. This may be because infomration is stored within smaller teams or on an individual's hardrive rather than a centralised space.</p> <p>Trying to collect information about a research project at the end of the project can be time consuming and inaccurate, as you have to work from memory or compile different documentation files stored in different places.</p> <p>By creating metadata, we build a coherent story of the data, documenting the research process from the very start. This documentation is centralised so everyone can access the up-to-date information about a project. For large research teams, this can be a great tool for ensuring people are on the same page.

Metadata documents different versions and iterations of data <p></p>   Metadata captures when data or the documentation around data are updated or changed, creating strong provenance. This gives a clear picture of the evolution of (meta)data in a research project and beyond, increasing it's transparency and credibility.    Creating metadata throughout each stage of the research data lifecycle saves time <p></p>  Creating metadata from the very start of the research data lifecycle allows you to build on information you've already captured and re-use metadata terms where necessary. This not only saves you time but ensures your metadata is consistent. Creating metadata as it happens further increases it's quality, as you capture information while it's fresh, rather than trying to remember all the details at the end of a research project."},{"location":"introduction/2.3%20Metadata%20in%20the%20research%20lifecycle/#map-the-metadata-to-the-research-lifecycle-stage","title":"Map the metadata to the research lifecycle stage","text":"<p>While metadata should be created and updated throughout the research lifecycle, what type of metadata you capture will depend on what stage of the research lifecycle your in.

If they're doing practical activities related to the case study, these would work as there's lots of existing data on mental health, education, politics, family structure/family structure transitions (e.g. marital status, divorce status), child development outcomes (e.g. health, education, social mobility) etc.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/2.4%20Using%20metadata%20-%20discover%20data/#tools-to-discover-research","title":"Tools to discover research","text":"<p>One common way people discover research is online, through data repositories and data catalogues. Data repositories and data catalogues are sometimes used interchangeably - but they are different tools.</p> <p>Data repository  The UK Data Service describes a data repository as 'a centralised database system that collects, manages, and stores datasets for later use'. They are designed for the long-term storage of datasets which can then be managed and accessed through the repository. </p> <p>Data catalogue  CODATA defines a data catalogue as a 'curated collection of metadata records describing datasets and their data elements. Curated and organised using a formal metadata schema appropriate to data and data sets (e.g. ReCollect etc).'. Sometimes a data catalogue is referred to as a metadata repository (note that this is different from a data repository which stores the actual data). <p></p></p> <p>The main difference between the two tools is that a data repository stores the actual data, whereas a data catalogue stores the metadata records only. When a researcher finishes a project, it's good practice to deposit data in a trusted repository to ensure its long-term preservation (note, this does not mean data needs to be open). When data is deposited in a repository, it then becomes searchable on associated data catalogue sites.

In the last unit 2.5, we looked at how controlled vocabularies can help standardise the terms used in our metadata so it becomes interoperable and machine readable.</p> <p>While controlled vocabularies standardise the content of metadata elements (i.e. the allowed inputs), metadata schemas and standards offer a broader framework around how to structure and define metadata elements.</p> <p>What is the benefit of using standards?</p> Everyday example: three pin plug analogy <p></p> Why should we standardise our data?  Imagine you\u2019ve got your phone charger with a standard UK 3-pin plug. You\u2019re at a train station in Leeds and need to charge your phone. You spot a socket, do you think your plug will fit?  Then, with the same plug, could you charge your phone in a library in Southampton, a caf\u00e9 in Cardiff or just back home?   We know our plug will work anywhere in the UK. Why? Because of standardisation.  All UK plugs and sockets follow the same design rules. These rules are part of a standard set out by International Organization for Standardization in their standard ISO 4400:1994. The standard is created by experts to make sure everything fits and works safely, no matter where you are.   What would happen if this standards didn't exist? - There would be different types of plugs, causing confusion and incompatability with sockets - You wouldn't be able to share plugs with other people - It would be hard to   What's the benefit of having a standard? - Simplifies workflows and increases efficiency - Enables sharing of resources - If a company follows a standard, they are likely to sell more products as people know they can use and trust the product   <p>Standards help simplify workflows and increase efficiency. As people work from the same specification, it enables clear communication and collaboraiton and reduces the risk of duplicating work or causing confusion.</p> <p>In this way, metadata standards and schemas help us further implement metadata best practice, increasing the consistency, quality and utility of metadata. They provide a common language so that there is a shared understanding of how data and related information is described.

A schema can be based on a metadata standard, drawing from the structure and definitions outlined in the standard to inform its structure and content. In this way, schemas can be seen as an expression of a standard. Whereas standards offer far reaching guidelines, schemas serve a narrower purpose outlining a more specific structure within the perameters of a standard. For example, a data repository or catalogue may provide a schema to follow in order to submit data to their site. You can also get schemas which have been developed independent of a metadata standard.</p> <p>Creating and using metadata schemas... - An individual may create their own metadata schema for a particular project - An individual may use a publicly available schema to create metadata for their project - An organisation may have an internal schema so anyone documenting information about a resource will capture the same metadata elements - A public repository may have a schema and require anyone wishing to deposit their data to use their schema</p> <p>For example, Gesis has created their own metadata schema to document resources being upload to the Gesis Data Archive (DAS). As Gesis is focused on social science research, it has based the schema on the standard Data Documentation Initiative Alliance (DDI Alliance) which is the leading standard for metadata across social, economic, and health sciences.

We chose social science over education as, while the research looks at education services, the data it collects will not solely be about the educational resources.

In this unit, we will look at how we can go about creating high level metadata for our own research project, describing what the project is about and how it was produced. As we go along, we will refer back to unit 2.5  and unit 2.6 to think about the tools we can use to create high-quality, effective metadata.</p> <p>Before we start, let's recap some of the key learnings from the earlier units in this course.</p> Who should create research project metadata? <p></p>  Every research project should caputre some level of metadata. Even if you're not planning to share or deposit your data, metadata is a helpful tool to help you organise your sources and research, so you can preserve your data and come back to it at a later date. For people who are sharing their data, metadata is an essential tool to help others find, understand and access your data, and is often an essential requirement of data repositories and data catalogues.   When should you create metadata? <p></p>  You can create metadata about your research project from the beginning. Starting at the beginning will save you time in the long-term and will allow you to update and add to your metadata as you go along. This means you can capture any changes made to the research project, creating provenance and provide transparency around the research process.   How can we produce high-quality metadata? <p></p>   **Metadata standards **  As we explored in [unit 2.6](&lt;2.6 Metadata standards.md&gt;), a metadata schema or standard can help make our metadata interoperable with other projects' metadata. Schemas and standards can also help us identify what metadata to create as they often specifcy what metadata elements to capture. You should select a metadata schema or standard at the very beginning of a reasearch project so you don't have to re-do or retrofit metadata into a standard at the end of a project.   What schema or standard to use depends on your research. You can select a discipline specific standard or an inter-disciplinary standard. If you want to deposit your data or metadata in a repository, the repository may require you to adhere to a specific schema or standard.    What metadata should you capture? <p></p>  What metadata elements you capture will depend on what you want to do with your research. If you want to share your research widely, you may need to include more metadata than if you just want to use metadata for your own personal reference only. If you are choosing to deposit your data or metadata into a catalogue or repository, they may specify what metadata elements you need to capture and they can sometimes provide a metadata template or schema to follow.   What metadata elements might we want to include to describe a research project? <p></p>  Metadata elements you could capture...  - Title of study - Date the data was collected - Creator of the data - Location of the research - Format the data is stored in - Data access information   How should you store metadata? <p></p>  Metadata should be created and stored in a machine readable format. To begin with, you can create study level metadata in an excel spreadsheet stored alongside your data files. There is also other software available to help create and manage metadata, we will explore this more in the Foundation course.   <p>[!NOTE] BO - The above looks like a recap of the previous units(?), so I'd add a sentence before \"Who should create research project metadata?\" to say something like \"Before we start, let's recap some of the key learnings from the earlier units in this course\", or something to show that it's a recap.

The standard is expressed as a simple schema which contains 15 core elements. While there is no universally agreed set of minimum metadata, Dublin Core is a useful guide for creating metadata for a research project so it can be documented and cited correctly. Depending on your project, some of the metadata elements may not be relevant for your research, so you can adjust what metadata elements to include accordingly.</p> <p>Dublin Core gives definitions of the metadata elements and guidance around what data to input into the metadata fields. These definitions are easy to find as each element has a link to the definition page.
