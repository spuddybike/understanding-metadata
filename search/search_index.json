These benefits are some of the many reasons FAIR is increasingly required by funders and scientific journals. </p> Maximises the value and use of data <p>Adopting FAIR practices ensures the long-term preservation and use of data. By using widely available software and depositing data in trusted repositories, data is discoverable and accessible for future use. This means data can outlive an individual project and be used as secondary data or in coss-study comparisons. Having strong documentation that uses standardised terms helps others to find, understand and use data, even if they don't have any contact with the original research team. For researchers who created the data, their data reaches more people and can be cited more widely, increasing their visibility without adding any further work.</p> Saves money, time and resources <p>By enabling data to be re-used in secondary research, cross-research comparison and in other outputs such as policy briefings, FAIR supports sustainable research practices. It reduces the risk of duplicating research and saves time, money and resources in conducting separate research projects collecting data on the same subject. It also ensures that data doesn\u2019t just get produced to exist independently, but it's used across the research community.</p> Improves the quality, accuracy and security of data <p>Creating strong documentation around your data and datasets as you go along reduces risk of losing or duplicating data.

In this unit, we'll examine what metadata is.</p> <p>Simply put, metadata describes your data. But what does that actually mean and why is it useful?</p> <p>Let's begin with an analogy.</p> <p>Imagine it's a hot day and you're thirsty. You have the option of two drinks.<sup>[1]</sup></p> Option 1Option 2 <p>A plain, sealed drink can left on a park bench ... <p></p> <p> </p> <p></p> Do you know what's inside the can? Would you want to drink it?</p> <p>This can in a local supermarket, would you know what is inside it? Would you be happy to drink it? <p></p> <p> <sup>[2]</sup><sup>[3]</sup> </p> <p></p> Do you know what's inside the can? Would you want to drink it?</p> <p>You probably picked Option 2. Why?</p> <p>As Option one does not have label, we don't know ...</p> <ul> <li>What's inside the can</li> <li>Where it's come from</li> <li>When it was made</li> <li>Who made it</li> </ul> <p>It's unlikely that anyone will want to drink from the can, and if they do, it's a risk.</p> <p>Alternatively, Option 2 has a label that contains...</p> <ul> <li>The brand</li> <li>Description of the drink and its flavour</li> <li>Ingredients list</li> <li>Nutritional information</li> <li>Production factory</li> <li>Location of production</li> <li>Producer contact information</li> <li>Best before date</li> </ul> <p>With that information, you'd feel more confident about what\u2019s inside the can and whether you want to drink it. You'd also trust it more if you found it in a shop alongside other drinks as you'd trust the shop to stock genuine products. Plus, you can compare labels of other products and make an informed choice about which drink to pick.</p> <p>It takes companies more time and resources to produce detailed packaging for products, so why do they do it?</p> Companies' personal interestLegally requiredConsumer needs <p>Companies want people to find and buy their product. If they can't, they will fail at their goal of selling and making profit. Having good information about the product makes it more trustworthy and engaging for customers so they are more likely to buy it.</p> <p>It may be legally required information, such as an ingredients list or place of origin. Without this, companies would not be able to produce and sell their products.</p> <p>The consumer of the drink requires this information in order to make an informed decision. For example, someone who needs to measure their sugar intake for their health needs a clear nutritional label. Someone with allergies will require information about ingredients and the factory of production.</p> <p>How does the drink analogy link to metadata in research?</p> <p>The drink inside the can represents a dataset from a research study. The label providing the information about the drink represents the metadata. </p> <p>Metadata describes the dataset, telling us how the dataset was produced and what it contains. Like the unlabelled can, if a research study doesn't have metadata, we don't know any contextual information such as who collected the data, when was the data collected or where. We also don't know what data exists within the datasets.</p> <p>Similar to storing the can in a supermarket, data repositories and data catalogues store metadata for different research projects in the same place, allowing us to search and compare across different projects. This increases the trustworthiness of the project and it's data. We will cover data repositories and data catalogues in more detail in unit 2.3</p> <p>In the same way having product information helps companies sell their products, metadata helps researchers make their data discoverable and reusable, leading to more citations of their data.

By being machine readable, metadata is also machine actionable, meaning we can use computers to get more functionality out of our documentation.</p> <p>Below, we explore these features in more depth.</p> StructuredMachine-readable and machine-actionable <p>Rather than a long text block, metadata is structured information that is separated into metadata elements. A metadata element is the container that describes what information the metadata is covering. It could be described as the title or the label for the metadata. For example, 'Title', 'Alternate Title', 'Publisher', 'Date', 'Author'.</p> <p>Sometimes there are rules around what input is allowed for a metadata element in order to make sure the information is clear and consistent. For example, for the metadata element 'Date', there may be a specification to format the information as dd/mm/yyyy.</p> <p>Relationships are mapped between different metadata elements, creating a structure and hierarchy to the information. For example, a variable belongs to a dataset and a dataset belongs to a study, or a person is linked to an organisation or a study. By explaining how each element connects to others, metadata makes the information easier to understand and navigate. This structure is also essential for machines to read and act on metadata correctly (we\u2019ll cover that in next tab). Without these relationships, you\u2019d end up with a confusing mix of information at different levels, all jumbled together.</p> <p>Metadata has to be stored in specific machine-readable formats such as JSON, csv, XML, and not in free text formats such as Microsoft Word or PDF. In order to store metadata in these formats, the information must be structured so computers can extract the information. If documentation includes different types of information in one paragraph and/or relies on formatting such as colour, italics, bold, underline to indicate different information, a machine will not be able to interpret its meaning.</p> <p>By being machine-readable, metadata can tell a computer what something is, how it relates to other objects or information, and what to do with the information. By being machine readable, metadata can also be machine-actionable. </p> <p>By describing how different metadata elements relate to each other, for example what categories they're in or if a piece of information is linked to another piece of information, machine's can not only read the metadata but also conduct further actions. </p> <p>For example, we can use computers to search and filter our metadata using sites such as data repositories and data catalogues.

If we didn't have metadata, TVs and Shoes would be mixed up in the same search and it'd take a long time to find the right product.</li> <li>Books registered on an online library catalogue have metadata like topic, author and data of publication, helping people find the book they need.</li> <li>AI is dependent on metadata to function.

When we talk about FAIR data, we usually think about only about the data itself, but the metadata also needs to be FAIR. If your metadata is well-structured and follows FAIR principles, it makes your data easier to discover, understand, and reuse, giving you and others the full benefit.</p> <p>Click the tabs below to explore how metadata makes our data FAIR and what steps we can take to make our data FAIR.</p> FindableAccessibleInteroperableReusable <p>Metadata describes your research, from the study level (e.g. title, author, location) to the variable level (e.g. variable name, data type, unit of measurement). It includes persistent identifiers (like DOIs) linked to a study or dataset. By making your metadata findable, you make your research findable.</p> <p>You can make your metadata findable by depositing it in a data or metadata catalogue. This makes it searchable on these platforms, allowing people to find it. You also need to store your metadata to be structured and stored in a machine readable format, such as XML, JSON or CSV. If it's not, machines will not be able to process and action your metadata meaning people will be less likely able to find it.</p> <p>Metadata specifies the access conditions (open or restricted) and protocols (HTTP, FTP, API) of your research data. It also provides license information so users know how they can use your data. This ensures that your data is both accessible and secure.</p> <p>You can make your metadata accessible by ensuring that your metadata is available even if you have closed data. By being publicly accessible, researchers know the dataset exists and how to request access.</p> <p>By describing your data in a structured way, metadata makes your research interoperable with centralised systems like data and metadata catalogues. If we had unstructured free-text description of our research, data and metadata catalogues wouldn't know how to process the information. This means your research can't be integrated into these systems and it would be hard to compare your research with other studies as there is no clear structure to follow.</p> <p>You can make your metadata interoperable by ensuring your metadata is structured and standardised where possible. Sometimes data and metadata catalogues provide you with schemas you can follow, ensuring you capture the necessary metadata in the correct way. Using controlled vocabularies further help you create interoperable metadata by providing standardised terms that are widely available. This reduces the risk of different studies using different words to mean the same thing. </p> <p>You can also follow metadata standards which define how metadata should be organised and provide consistency in the terms you use. This means you will be able to compare and exchange metadata with any study that uses the same standard as you. The power of a standard increases if more people use it as more studies become interoperable. So, even if you're not planning on depositing your metadata to a data or metadata catalogue, following a metadata schema and/or standard can help you implement a clear structure for your metadata and make it interoperable for future use.</p> <p>Metadata makes your research easier to find and understand, which naturally encourages data reuse. It gives the background and context for a study, helping others interpret the data correctly. By recording the data\u2019s provenance, metadata builds trust and reliability, making your data more likely to be used in future research.</p> <p>If your metadata follows standards and is interoperable, your study can be compared and combined with other datasets, opening the door to new research questions. Finally, metadata outlines the license and usage terms, so people know exactly how they\u2019re allowed to use your data.</p> <p>The guidelines below explore how to make both our data and metadata FAIR<sup>[19]</sup>...</p> <p></p> <p>In the following units, we look further into how we can implement this guidance using data repositories and catalogues unit 2.3), controlled vocabularies (unit 2.4 and metadata standards (unit 2.5).</p> <p>You can test your FAIR knowledge with Data Archiving and Networking Service's (DANS) FAIR Aware tool.

Information about data or research activities can be lost at different stages, stored in silos or not recorded at all. This means we don't have a clear picture of how the research was conducted or how the data was produced, limiting the transparency and trustworthiness of the project.</p> <p>Creating metadata from the start of the research lifecycle builds a coherent story of the research activities and data throughout each stage. This is more efficient than creating metadata at the end of a project which can be time consuming and inaccurate as you have to rely on memory or pull together scattered documentation. Creating metadata helps you manage your data as you collect it, ensuring it can be properly archived and disseminated with the right level of documentation. </p> <p>Having metadata stored in a centralised space means everyone can access the latest information about a project. For large research teams, this helps ensure everyone is on the same page and avoids the risk of producing multiple forms of the same documentation.</p> <p>By creating metadata for your project, you have the information required for publishing your data easily accessible. For external audiences engaging with your research, your metadata helps people understand and trust your data, making it more likely for people to cite and re\u2011use your data.</p> <p>How does creating metadata help us throughout the research lifecycle?</p> <p>Expand the boxes to explore some of the benefits below.</p> Metadata connects the research process <p>Metadata can connect and accumulate information throughout the research process, building on previous information to document the whole data lifecycle in a coherent way, benefitting people both within a research project and externally.</p> Metadata documents different versions and iterations of data <p>Metadata captures when data or the documentation around data are updated or changed, creating strong provenance. This gives a clear picture of the evolution of (meta)data in a research project and beyond, increasing its transparency and credibility. </p> Creating metadata throughout each stage of the research lifecycle saves time <p>Creating metadata from the very start of the research lifecycle allows you to build on information you've already captured and re-use metadata terms where necessary. This not only saves you time but ensures your metadata is consistent. Creating metadata as it happens further increases its quality, as you capture information while it's fresh, rather than trying to remember all the details at the end of a research project.</p> <p>Map the metadata to the research lifecycle stage</p> <p>While metadata should be created and updated throughout the research lifecycle, the type of metadata you create will depend on where you are in the research lifecycle.

They also provide citation information, meaning that when we are doing a vast amount of research to find secondary data or a literature review, data catalogues and metadata help us efficiently collect and store the important citation data.  </p> <p>Now try find a repository and/or catalogue that is relevant to your area of research. You can use sites like re3data.org or FAIRsharing.org, or talk to other researchers in your field to identify the leading repositories and/or catalogues.</p> <p>The role of metadata in data catalogues</p> <p>How do you think we are using metadata to help us find relevant research projects on data catalogues?</p> <p>The reason we can search and filter data catalogues is because each study has metadata. Without it, we'd have to open every study page individually to understand what it's about and whether it's relevant to our work. As metadata is machine readable and machine actionable, we have the power to tailor our searches and scan lots of resources in a structured, efficient way.</p> <p>Keywords search tool</p> <p>When you type search terms into a data catalogue, the system scans the metadata and returns the resources that best match your query.</p> <p>Filter tool </p> <p>Data catalogues use metadata to power their filter functions. When we narrow down search results by criteria such as geographical location, publication date, the organisation behind the research, the topics covered, or the level of data access, we are using the studies' metadata to organise our search. If a study didn't have this metadata, the filters wouldn't work and now results would be shown in our search.</p> <p>Some sites also allow you to search and filter metadata about variables and questions (if the data was collected by a survey). For example...</p> <ul> <li>UK Data Service: Variable and question bank allows users to search the variables and questions within datasets and data collection tools</li> <li>CLOSER Discovery: Variable and question search also offers users to search through variable and question metadata</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/2.3%20Using%20metadata%20-%20discover%20data/#using-metadata-understand-data","title":"Using metadata: understand data","text":"<p>Once we have used the search and filter functions on a data catalogue to find relevant research projects, how can metadata help us understand what a research project is about?</p> <p>Finding \u2192 understanding</p> <p>When we select a particular research study in a search list, we are taken to the profile page. </p> <p>On this page we can see the metadata describing the overall project.

By standardising the metadata requirements, the same level of information is available for each study on the site. This makes it possible to search and compare easily. We will explore other tools that are used to standardise metadata for data catalogues in the upcoming units 2.4 and 2.5.</p> <p>Understanding research projects in more detail</p> <p>Data catalogues usually provide the overall picture of a research project. As we explored in unt 2.1, having more information about the variables within a dataset helps us understand a study further and assess whether it is relevant to our research needs.</p> <p> </p> <p>How do we find metadata that describes variables and the type of data within a dataset?</p> <p>On some data catalogues you can explore variable metadata which is linked to the dataset you've selected. For example ...</p> <ul> <li>You review metadata for an individual variable, such as the data type and linked questions, on UK Data Service Variable and Question Bank. For example, the variable 'Past health problems - 5' from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (July - September 2024 study). <sup>[4]</sup></li> <li>On CLOSER Discovery you can find similar variable metadata. For example, the variable '(A1) Did CM receive housing benefit whilst at address' from the National Child Development Study. <sup>[5]</sup></li> </ul> <p>On CLOSER Discovery, you can also find metadata for an individual question. For example, the variable 'How interested you are in Politics' from the WAVE 7 of Understanding Society study <sup>[6]</sup>. This gives us information about variables linked to the question, where the question appears in the questionnaire, how the participant could respond the question and the topics the question relates to. </p> <p>On some data catalogues, you can also use variable and question metadata to discover data. On CLOSER Discovery and the UK Data Service, you can search and filter at the variable and question level. For example...</p> <p>The UK Data Service has a dedicated Variable and Question Bank.</p> <p> </p> <p>On CLOSER discovery, you can filter by variables or questions.</p> <p> </p> <p>By being able to search across lots of questions and variables in different datasets, we can spot opportunities to reuse existing data for new research or make cross study comparisons. Without variable and question metadata, we might not realise that two different studies, despite having a different overall focus, actually have comparable data. This means we could miss out on re-using data and could end up duplicating work.</p> <p>Where data is open, some sites have used variable and question metadata to make their data interactive. For example, the British Election Study has created a 'Data Playground' which allows users to create graphs using data from across all their studies conducted over the past 60 years. This functionality only works because all studies have detailed and standardised variable and question metadata. Without that, the 'Data Playground' wouldn\u2019t be able to link or compare anything across studies.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/2.3%20Using%20metadata%20-%20discover%20data/#understanding-research-codebooks-and-data-dictionaries","title":"Understanding research: Codebooks and data dictionaries","text":"<p>Another way we can access variable and question metadata is through documentation stored alongside datasets.

By using a public available controlled vocabulary over creating a personal one, your metadata reflects the latest understanding in your discipline, strengthening it's accuracy and standardising it further.</p> <p>The power of a controlled vocabulary increases when it becomes widely adopted, as it makes metadata using the same vocabulary interoperable. This means metadata can be integrated into centralised systems such as data catalogues (which we explored in unit 2.3) and used to enable search and filter functions. The information can also be easily compared across studies and resources. As such, it's best practise to use publicly available controlled vocabularies where possible. It also means you don't have to create a vocabulary from scratch, so it saves you time in your metadata creation.</p> <p>For example, a country could be referred to in different ways ...</p> <ul> <li>America, United States, US</li> <li>Netherlands, Holland</li> </ul> <p>Or in different languages ...</p> <ul> <li>America, Am\u00e9rique, \u0391\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627</li> <li>Netherlands, Nederland, Hollanda, \ub124\ub35c\ub780\ub4dc</li> </ul> <p>To standardise this information, we can use the publicly available controlled vocabulary ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Country Codes<sup>[4]</sup>.

In this unit, we'll explore creating metadata.</p> <p>How do you decide what metadata to create?</p> <p>What metadata you choose to create depends on the aims of your research and what you want to do with it. If your data is only for personal use, your metadata might only need to capture key details that will be useful for your current and future work. However, if you\u2019re planning to share your research more widely and/or deposit it in a data repository or catalogue, you\u2019ll likely need to create more metadata to help others understand and use your data. A data repository or catalogue, may also require you to follow a metadata schema to ensure your metadata is interoperable with the other studies on the site.</p> <p>In this unit, we'll unpack creating study level metadata. </p> <p>Creating metadata for a study</p> <p>As we explored in unit 2.5, using a metadata standard or schema can help ensure our metadata is consistent and interoperable. It also saves us time as it provides deinfed elements and a clear structure so we don't have to create it from scratch.</p> <p>A common cross-discipline standard is Dublin Core which is used across domains to describe a variety of resources including digital (web pages, datasets, images, videos) and physical (books, artifacts) objects<sup>[1]</sup>. The standard is expressed as a simple schema which contains 15 core elements<sup>[2]</sup>. In some cases, not all of the metadata elements may be relevant so you can adjust the standard to your needs.</p> <p>Dublin Core gives definitions of the metadata elements and guidance around what data to input into the metadata fields. For example, for dates, they recommend adhering to ISO 8601-1 standard which specifies YYYY-MM-DD format.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/2.6%20Creating%20metadata%2C%20study%20level/#dublin-core-simple-metadata-generator","title":"Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator","text":"<p>You can create Dublin Core metadata in any machine readable format.</p> <p>For the following exercises, we will use an simple online generator developed by Nick Steffel.

It enables researchers to assess the quality and relevance of data, and ultimately to act on it by re\u2011using, sharing, or building upon it with confidence. </p> How does metadata help us find data? <p>Metadata powers data catalogues which are a key discovery tool in research. On these sites, a large number of studies are listed so people can find past studies for their own work, whether to reference or to use as secondary data. Without metadata, we wouldn't be able to search or filter these sites, intstead we would have to scroll through hundreds of pages and click into every individual record to find studies that relevant for our work. As metadata is machine readable and machine actionable, it helps organise all the studies on a data catalogue and provides us with the data to filter and search.</p> How does metadata help us understand data? <p>As a structured form of data documentation, metadata gives the context of a study. It explains the who, what, where, why and how of the data. Without this, we wouldn't know what data a study has collected or, if we have the study's dataset, we would struggle to interpet the data as it would just appear to be numbers or text with no meaning. By providing extra information that wouldn't otherwise be captured in the dataset, metadata helps researchers understand how the data was produced and how to interpet the data once they have the dataset. </p> How does metadata help us reuse data? <p>By helping people discover and understand existing research, metadata helps people reuse existing data. This is particularly important when finding secondary data or conducting research to see what studies have already been conducted in our area. Without metadata, we might not know a study in our area of interest has been conducted and we run the risk of duplicating research. By making these studies findable and understandable, metadata to helps us resue data, saving us time, money and resources.</p> <p>A dataset created for one research question might also contain data valuable for a completely different enquiry. This may not be obvious when reading about an overall study however metadata, such as variable descriptions, makes these connections visible. People can then identify these opportunities and repurpose existing data, meaning we maximise the potential of data.By documenting the provenance of data, metadata helps maintain the credibility and trustworthiness of data so it can be used reliably to support other research enquiries. </p>"},{"location":"introduction/2.7%20Introduction%20summary/#why-create-metadata","title":"Why create metadata?","text":"<p>Creating metadata is essential for good research data management and implementing the FAIR data principles in research.</p> <p>FAIR and sustainable research</p> <p>Metadata is not a nice-to-have, it is an asset that can be used to your advantage, making your data go further and maximising the potential of research. Metadata is a key part of making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). When we talk about FAIR data, we usually think about only about the data itself, but the metadata also needs to be FAIR. If your metadata is well-structured and follows FAIR principles, it makes your data easier to discover, understand, and reuse, giving you and others the full benefit.</p> <p>Metadata helps us manage our data during the research process. By capturing information around file formats, versioning and provenance of the data as we go along, metadata documents the research process clearly. It enables us to organise our data and make sure it's secure, reducing the risk of losing data or accidentally allowing restricted data to be accessible. As such, metadata improves our research data management, making our data more trustworthy and helping us preserve it for future use. It may also be needed as part of a funding or journal requirement as evidence of data sharing and well managed data.</p> <p>Research data management</p> <p>Metadata helps you manage your data in a consistent and structured way. This is useful during the research process to make sure your keep your data secure and correctly organised. It can also help you in the future when you return to a previous study after many years as metadata can give you the context and information to understand your data and how it was collected so you don't have to rely on memory.</p> <p>Make your data discoverable and re-usable</p> <p>If you're sharing your data, metadata makes your data easier to find, understand, and reuse by other people. For example, by having metadata, your data can become findable on platforms such as data catalogues and repositories. Strong provenance metadata can also help people trust your data, as your research processes are clear and transparent. This means your data is more likely to be cited and re-used, increasing your visibility of as a researcher and the impact of your research.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/2.7%20Introduction%20summary/#good-quality-metadata","title":"Good quality metadata","text":"<p>What are the features of good quality metadata?</p> <ul> <li>Accurate descriptions that provide the appropriate level of information necessary to understand a project</li> <li>Being consistent with the use of terms within a project's metadata to avoid confusion or misinformation</li> <li>Use standardised terms that are commonly used within the relevant discipline and are unlikely to become redundant</li> <li>Interoperability of metadata with other studies' so it can be compared across resources and deposited on centralised platforms such as data catalogues where it can be searched and filtered</li> </ul> What tools can help us create good quality metadata? <ul> <li>Controlled vocabularies </li> <li>Metadata standards and schemas</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction/Bibliography/","title":"Bibliography","text":""},{"location":"introduction/Bibliography/#unit-11-research-data","title":"Unit 1.1 Research data","text":"<ul> <li>Apple Inc.
