## What is data?

In the Introduction course, we will look at how we can manage and document research data. Before we do this, it's important to have a strong understanding of what data is, the characteristics of data, and the role of data in research. <p></p>

We use the term "data" all the time, but what do we actually mean? We constantly engage with data in our everyday lives. Take your weather app for example. <p></p>

What data is available when we check the weather?

<details>
<summary><b>Data on the weather app</b></summary>
<p></p>

<img src="img/weatherdatacircled1.png" alt="Alt Text" width="425" height="900"> 


The app gives us data on weather conditions for a specified time and location, such as...
- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Cloud coverage

</details>

## Representation of data

In this weather app example, we gain information about the _measurement_ of weather conditions in London by interpreting data. We interpret different types of data to do this.

For example, we interpret data that is ...
  - Numbers e.g. 16*
  - Text e.g. 'Sunny conditions'
  - Symbols e.g. :sunny:
  - Date/Time e.g. 14:00

We can also interpret the same information about the same concept using different _repsentations of data_.
Take cloud coverage as an example. We could gain information about cloud coverage through the following representations of data...
  - Text e.g. 'Partially cloudy'
  - Symbols e.g. 🌥️
  - Numnber e.g. 4 Oktas (okta is a scale of measurement used to describe the amount of cloud cover on a scale between 0-8) 

So data doesn't come in one set format. Instead, there are different _representations of data_ which convey the same information. By interpreting these representations, we gain meaning from the data.

>[!NOTE]
>KR Is it corrent to call Okta number here rather than scale?

## Generic definition of data

So, how could we go about defining data?

Data has different definitions in different contexts and disciplines.

Wikipedia offers a broad understanding of data as ...<br>
>"...a collection of discrete or continuous *values* that convey *information* describing the *quantity, quality, fact, statistics*, or other basic units of meaning, or sequences of *symbols* that may be further interpreted *formally*"[^1]

Taking a more business focus, IBM defines data as ...<br>
>'...a collection of facts, numbers, words, observations or other useful information. Through data processing and data analysis, organizations transform raw data points into valuable insights that improve decision-making and drive better business outcomes.'[^2]

Looking at data from a research perspective, CODATA conceives data as...<br>
>'Facts, measurements, recordings, records, or observations about the world, collected by researchers, that are yet to be processed/interpreted/analysed. Data may be in any format or medium taking the form of writings, notes, numbers, symbols, text, images, films, video, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, designs or other graphical representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing algorithms, or statistical records.'[^3]

While each definition has a slightly different focus, a common theme is that data can be interpreted in order to provide information about the topic or object the data is describing.

## Research data

Data used for research can be called **research data**. As it is used in a specific context and for specific aims, research data can be given a narrower definition.

CODATA defines resesarch data as...

> 'Data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. All other digital and non-digital content have the potential of becoming research data. Research data may be experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data. Therefore, while data in research still conveys information (as the previous definition noted), it is in relation to a specific enquiry or activity.'[^4]

So, while research data can come in lots of different representations, all research data has the same underlying purpose of being 'used as evidence in a research process'.
<p></p> 
Reflecting on the definition above, what could be the core characteristics of research data that differentiate it from general information?
<p></p>

<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics of data</b></summary>

Data relates to a **concept** that we want to study and know more about. 

- In the weather app example, this could be...
  - 16* &rarr; temperature
  - London &rarr; geography
  - 14:00 &rarr; time

Data is **collected, observed or measured** by an individual or an organisation with the intention of finding out more about a particular concept.

  - For example, a meteorologist or the Met Office will collect data about the weather in different locations and different times.

### Unpacking research data

Let's unpack the concept of research data further.

Research data is the outcome of the research lifecycle which could be concieved as ...

  ``` mermaid
  
  flowchart LR
    sitw(Something in the world) --> Rec(Which is recorded)
    Rec --> Rep(Has a representation)

 ```

If the 'representation' is the data we use in research, what could the first two boxes be?
What does something in the world refer to?
How was it recorded?

   ``` mermaid

    flowchart LR
      Q1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> Q2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
      Q2 --> Rep1(Has a representation)

 ```

---

## Data as a research object 

'Something in the world' can be described as the **concept** we are intentionally researching.<br>
'Which is recorded' relates to the **measure** we use to record the concept.<br>
We then use a **representation** to record individual cases of the measure. This is our data.<br>

  ``` mermaid
  
  flowchart LR
    sitw(Something in the world) --> Rec(Which is recorded)
    Rec --> Rep(Has a representation)


 ```


  ``` mermaid

  flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> D(Data)

  ```

This outlines how in the research lifecycle, we generate a hypothesis on a particular **concept** (something in the world), we **measure** the concept in order to test the hypothesis (which is recorded), producing **data** from our measurements (has a representation).

For example, you may want to collect data for a research activity that involves knowing the age of every participant in a study.<br>

<details>
<summary>What is <b>the concept</b> we want to capture?</summary>
<p></p>

- Age of person.

</details>

\----

<details>
<summary>What units could we use to <b>measure</b> age?</summary>
<p></p>

- Years, months, days, minutes, seconds.
- In order for research data to be suitable for analysis, we can only use _one_ unit of measurement for each concept. So, we couldn't write age as 5 years and 4 months as we would be mixing to units of measurement; years and months. Instead, we could write age as 5 years _or_ 64 months, keeping the one-to-one relationship between concept and measure.
- The way we conduct this measurement will be our data collection method. For example, we may measure age by asking research participants the question 'What is your age?' in a questionnaire. A questionnaire would therefore be our data collection method.

</details>

\----

<details>
<summary>How would would we represent that <b>data</b>?</summary>
<p></p>

- Say we choose to measure age in years. We use numbers so we would record this data numerically. The valid range of numbers that would be acceptable would start from 0 (as your age cannot be in minus numbers) to roughly 115, based on the average lifespan of a person.
- The collection of this data will make up our dataset.

>KR moved comments and reference to multiple measurements to the foundation course - variable metadata unit

## Identifying the concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data of research data

### Measuring a person's age

This is how we would conceive a person's age as research data: concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    aop(Age of person) --> Ye(Years)
    Ye --> yd(0...115)

```

### Measuring weather data

Now lets go back to [the weather data](#weather-data-...) we looked at at the start of the course. 

Can you fill in the blank research data flow for a piece of data from that screenshot?

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> D(Data)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```

<details>
<summary><b>Temperature</b></summary>
<p></p>

One concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow you might have captured is the temperature in London.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    tol(Temperature of London) --> de(Degrees)
    de --> td("-20...45")

```

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Wind gusts</b></summary>
<p></p>


Or you might have looked at wind gusts.<br>

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    wgl(Wind gusts in London) --> mph(Miles per hour)
    mph --> mphd("0...100")

```

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Chance of rain</b></summary>
<p></p>

Or chance of rain.<br>

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    cor(Chance of rain in London) --> prc(Percent)
    prc --> prcd("0...100")

```

</details>

As we can see above, the research data you focus on will influence what concept you're measuring, and determine what the concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data will be.

</details>

### Measuring time spent on social media

Let's try another research context.

Imagine you are doing research into young people's relationship with social media.<br>
As part of this research, you need to find out how long each research participant spends on a social media platform per day. Try creating a concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow for this enquiry.<br>

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> D(Data)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```

<details>
<summary><b>Concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow</b></summary>
<p></p>

One answer could be:

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    tsosm(Time Spent on Social Media) --> min(Minutes)
    min --> d(0...1440)

```

</details>

### Research data in your work

If you're currently doing research, consider what research data you're collecting.<br>

Trying complete a concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow for your research.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> D(Data)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```
