## INTRODUCTION  OVERVIEW

---
## Aim and objectives

**Objective:** Create open access online training tailored to both learners (participants) and trainers (train the trainers) around metadata in research. Raise awareness of what metadata is, the main features and tools of metadata and why they are important.

**Aim:** Participants will understand what metadata is, why it is important (the benefits of metadata), and the common tools used for implementing best practice. The introduction course will create the 'buy-in' for wanting to create metadta as a researcher. Trainers will feel confident with content and resources to deliver the training in person to other participants.

## Audience and delivery

**Audience:**
- Both metadata users and creators
  - Participants: masters/doctoral students, early career researchers, data managers, funders
    - Cross-disciplines, training should not be discipline specific
  - Train the trainers: course tutors, doctoral students, librarian/learning centres

**Delivery**
- Mode: Remote
  - In first instance, training is developed on github and exported to interactive website with ppt and pdf materials
  - Interactive elements, e.g. links to case studies, worked examples examples, embedded videos and suggestions of activities to complete on own research
- Features: videos (also make available on youtube), worked group examples (with answers supploed in the course), application to dataset

---
## Resources

**Accompanying resources:**
- Template dataset (for those who do not use their own)
- Worksheet (?) â€“ summary of activities that the course will include with spaces for their answers
- Takeaway resource: overview booklet that contains a high-level summary of content (to be available for download / made available to participants once they have completed the course). This should include templates which could be useful for their work and list of external tools and resources available on other sites

**Training resources:**
- Training guidance handbook (short pdf handout)
- Material available to export as ppt for delivery

Participant resource requirements: bring own dataset (specification needs to be set out for dataset), nor prior learning to require
