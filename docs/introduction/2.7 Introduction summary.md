## Defining metadata

> Data about data. Defines and describes the characteristics of other data. It is used to improve the understanding and use of the data. - CODATA RDM 2025

In contrast to other forms of data documentation,  metadata is that it is **machine readable** and **machine actionable**. 

## How is metadata used in research 

Metadata is essential for good research data management and for creating trustworthy, reusable research. It’s a key part of making data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

When we talk about FAIR data, we usually think about only about the data itself, but the metadata also needs to be FAIR. If your metadata is well-structured and follows FAIR principles, it makes your data easier to discover, understand, and reuse, giving you and others the full benefit.

**How does metadata help us discover data?**

<details> 
<summary>Discovery</summary>
<p></p>
Metadata powers data catalogues which are a key discovery tool in research. On these sites, a large number of studies are listed so people can find past studies for their own work, whether to reference or to use as secondary data. Without metadata, we wouldn't be able to search or filter these sites, intstead we would have to scroll through hundreds of pages and click into every individual record to find studies that relevant for our work. As metadata is machine readable and machine actionable, it helps organise all the studies on a data catalogues and provides us with the data to filter and search.

**How does metadata help us understand data?**

<details> 
<summary>Understanding</summary>
<p></p>
As a structured form of data documentation, metadata gives the context of a study. It explains the who, what, where, why and how of the data. Without this, we wouldn't know what data a study has collected or, if we have the study's dataset, we would struggle to interpet the data as it would just appear to be numbers or text with no meaning. By providing extra information that wouldn't otherwise be captured in the dataset, metadata helps researchers understand how the data was produced and how to interpet the data once they have the dataset.

**How does metadata help us reuse data?**

<details> 
<summary>Reuse</summary>
<p></p>
By helping people discover and understand existing research, metadata helps people reuse existing data. Without metadata, we might not know a study in our area of interest has been conducted and we run the risk of duplicating research. By making these studies findable and understandable, metadata to helps us resue data, saving us time, money and resources.

A dataset created for one research question might also contain data valuable for a completely different enquiry. This may not be obvious when reading about an overall study however metadata, such as variable descriptions, makes these connections visible. People can then identify these opportunities and repurpose existing data, meaning we maximise the potential of data.

By documenting the provenance of data, metadata helps maintain the credibility and trustworthiness of data so it can be used reliably to support other research enquiries.

**How does metadata make our data FAIR?**

<p></p>
<b>Findable</b><br>
Metadata describes your research, from the study level (e.g. title, author, location) to the variable level (e.g. variable name, data type, unit of measurement). It includes persistent identifiers (like DOIs) linked to a study or dataset. By making your metadata findable, you make your research findable.
<p></p>
You can make your metadata findable by depositing it in a data or metadata catalogue. This makes it searchable on these platforms, allowing people to find it. You also need to store your metadata to be structured and stored in a machine readable format, such as XML, JSON or CSV. If it's not, machines will not be able to process and action your metadata meaning people will be less likely able to find it.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Accessible</b><br>
Metadata specifies the access conditions (open or restricted) and protocols (HTTP, FTP, API) of your research data. It also provides license information so users know how they can use your data. This ensures that your data is both accessible and secure.
<p></p>
You can make your metadata accessible by ensuring that your metadata is available even if you have closed data. By being publicly accessible, researchers know the dataset exists and how to request access.
<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>Interoperable</b><br>
By describing your data in a structured way, metadata makes your research interoperable with centralised systems like data and metadata catalogue. If we had unstructured free-text desciption of our research, data and metadata catalogues wouldn't know how to process the information. This means our research can't be integrated into the system or compared with other studies.
<p></p>
You can make your metadata interoperable by ensuring your metadata is structured. Sometimes data and metadata catalogues provide you with schmeas that you can follow, ensuring you capture the necessary metadata in the correct way so it can be integrated into the system. You can also follow schemas and standards

## Why create metadata?

Metadata is not a nice-to-have, it is an asset that can be used to your advantage, making your data go further and maximising the potential of research. It may also be required by funders or research insitutions.

**Why create metadata for your own data?**

Metadata helps you manage your data in a consistent and structured way. This is useful during the research process to make sure your keep your data secure and correctly organised. It can also help you in the future when you return to a previous study after many years as metadata can give you the context and information to understand your data and how it was collected so you don't have to rely on memory.

Moreover, if you're sharing your data, metadata makes your data easier to find, understand, and reuse by other people. For example, by having metadata, your data can become findable on platforms such as data catalogues and repositories. Strong provenance metadata can also help people trust your data, as your research processes are clear and transparent. This means your data is more likely to be cited and re-used, increasing your visibility of as a researcher and the impact of your research.

**How does metadata help you use other people's data?**

In the same way metadata helps people find our data, it can help us find other people's data. This is particularly important when finding secondary data or conducting research to see what studies have already been conducted in our area. Robust metadata helps us understand a research project quickly as well as assess whether it's relevant for our needs. If the project has rich metadata, for example information describing the variables within the dataset, we can even find data we can use within research studies we didn't think were relevant at first glance. 

**Who might require you to create metadata?**

Metadata plays a key role in FAIR data, a standard to which the research community are working towards. Recognising the far reaching benefits many
