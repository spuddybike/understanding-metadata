## FAIR data principles

In 2016, Mark D. Wilkinson, Michel Dumontier, Ijsbrand Jan Aalbersberg and a host of other academic and professional contributors from industry, funding agencies and scholarly publishers, published an article called “FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship” for Scientific Data.[^1]

FAIR was presented as a guiding set of principles to support the reusability of data with a specific focus on technology, improving the sharing and re-use of data, and tackling some of the challenges we encountered in [unit 1.2](<1.2 Research data management.md>).[^2]

In short, the FAIR principles outline the features that make data good quality data. 

FAIR proposes data should be...

- **F**indable
  - Other people can discover your data and data documentation.
- **A**ccessible
  - Your data and data documentation is accessible by other people (as per data permissions). 
- **I**nteroperable
  - Your data and data documentation should be easily integrated and combined with other studies.
- **R**e-usable
   - Your data can be re-used by other people, serving multiple research purposes beyond the original project.

**Note, FAIR data does not mean open data.** FAIR suggests data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

Since being created, the FAIR data principles have become a core component in research data management and should be considered in any research project.

By setting a standard of good quality data, FAIR provides the guiding principles for research data management across all disciplines.

You can watch a short video to gain of an overview of FAIR in research.

So, what can we do to enact these principles in our research?

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other people can easily find your data and the documentation around your data and research project.

**What you can do ...**
  - Deposit your data in a trusted repository or archive so people can find your data when searching these sites. The repository will also create a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for your data, which is a persistent and unique link that will not break. This can be used to cite data, making it easy to find. (we will look at data repositories in more detail in unit 2.4)
- Some repositories may create a Persistent Identifier  (PID) for individuals, however you can also create and manage a PID for yourself using [Orchid ID](https://orcid.org/). This can help ensure you are correctly attributed in your research.
- Use a DOI to cite other publications and datasets referenced in your research.
- <mark>**Create metadata**</mark> that describes your project and can be readily accessed stored on data repositories and catalogues alongside your data (we will delve into metadata in the coming the units and cover metadata creation in unit [2.7](<2.7 Creating metadata: study level>)

>[!NOTE]
>BO - What do we mean by creating a PID "for yourself"? Like an ORCID ID to link to your research profile? Or for your dataset/research materials? I think we should add an example.<br>
>JJ - I think we should remove bullet 2 & 3 as the only viable route for most people is to use a respository such as Zenodo, FigShare etc to create a PID for you, which is covered in bullet 4<br>
> KR Have edited slightly - does this make it more clear? Or can remove bullet points all together

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: your data and data documentation are accessible by other people. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, documentation that outlines what your data is descibing and what the data sharing policies are should be available. FAIR states data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

**What you can do...**
  - Use technology and software that is readily available and widely used in your discipline so people can access your data easily, if required. Where possible, use open software rather than proprietary software that some people may not have the resources to use. 
  - Use the latest version of a software to store your data to reduce the risk of your data being stuck in an outdated format (the best software for your data will depend on the data you have collected).
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format so your data can be found on their webpages and catalogues.
  - <mark>**Create metadata**</mark> that outlines how other people can access your data.

---

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: data and data documentation should be easily integrated and combined with other datasets and documentation.

**What you can do...**
  - Ensure your data and data documentation is clean and well structured, identifying and correcting any input or format errors. This will make sure your data is ready to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. It can then also be integrated with other data should data comparison and re-use take place.
  - Use tools to standardise your data and data documentation such as controlled vocabularies, classifications and ontologies (we will explore these tools  in [unit 2.5](2.5 Controlled vocabularies)).
  - <mark>**Create metadata**</mark> that complies with relevant metadata standards and schemas (we will cover metadata standards and schemas in more depth in [unit 2.6](< 2.6 Metadata standards.md>). Metadata that uses the same standard are more interoperable and can easily be compared and integrated. 
   
---

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: data should be available for future research, study and processing, for example in secondary research and cross-study comparisons.

**What you can do...**
- Select a clear data usage and sharing license.
- Use terms that are used widely in your discipline and/or standardised by an academic community in a formal vocabulary (more information about standardisation tools such as controlled vocabularies and metadata stndards in unit 2.4 and unit 2.5).
- <mark>**Create metadata**</mark> to describe the context and contents of your study and its data so other researchers can assess whether they can re-use data for their study.

## The benefits of FAIR

Below are some of the benefits of FAIR data. These benefits are some of the many reasons FAIR is increasingly requried by funders and scientific journals. 

How do you think enables these benefits? Click through the tabs to see suggestions 

<details>
<summary><b>Improves the efficiency and accuracy of the research process</b></summary>
<p></p>

Creating a clear record of the data you collect as you go, noting down what datasets contain and where they're stored, helps you avoid the risk of losing or duplicating data. If you need to produce reports about your research process, all the information is ready to go and you don't need to hunt down missing datasets. This saves you the challenge of having to document data retrospectively at the end of a project.

</details>

\----

<details>
<summary><b>Improves the quality and trustworthiness of research</b></summary>
<p></p>

By documenting your dataset and research methods, FAIR provides proof of transparent and valid conduct, providing people with confidence in data and research. Having clear and robust documentation builds trust, fosters collaboration, and strengthens the credibility of research findings.

</details>

\----

<details>
<summary><b>Maximises the value and usefulness of data</b></summary>
<p></p>

Adopting FAIR practices, ensures the long-term preservation and use of data. By using standard software and depositing data in trusted repositories, data is securely stored and discoverable for other people. This means data can outlive an individual project and can be used by other projects as secondary data or in a cross-study comparison. Having strong documentation that uses standardised terms further helps others to find, understand and use  data, even if they don't have any contact with the original research team. It’s a bit like leaving a clear, well-labeled recipe behind instead of a messy list of ingredients. For researchers who created the data, their data reaches more people and can be cited more widely, increasing their visibility without adding any further work.

</details>

\----

<details>
<summary><b>Saves money, time and resources</b></summary>
<p></p>

By enabling data to be re-used in secondary research, cross-research comparison and in other outputs such as policy briefings, we enable data to go further and reduce the risk of duplicating research. This saves time, money and resources in conducting separate research projects. It also ensures that data doesn’t just get produced to exist independently, but it's used acrossed the research community.

## FAIR in action

Everyone can contribute to implementing FAIR. Within the research field, infrastructures help enable the practice of FAIR data. These include data repositories, data catalogues, standards, data guidelines and software to manage and store data. As someone creating or engaging with research data, you can practice FAIR data by using these tools.

For example, if you're currently working on a dataset, you can implement FAIR by completing the following tasks ...

**Findable**
- Explore guidance on deciding where where to deposit your data on [DCC here](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)
- Find a trusted repository to deposit your data by using [this guide from OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/find-trustworthy-data-repository)
- Follow DCC's guidance on ['How to Cite Datasets and Link to Publications' here](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/cite-datasets)
- Create a Persistent Idenfitier for yourself with [Orchid ID](https://orcid.org/)
<p></p> 

**Accessible**:
- Determine the best file format for your data by using [this guide from UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/)
<p></p> 

**Interoperable**
- Clean your dataset with open source tools such as [Open Data Editor](https://opendataeditor.okfn.org/) or [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), making sure errors are identified and corrected and the dataset is structured effectively 
<p></p> 

**Re-usable** 
  - Find a data sharing license best suited for your research by using [Creative Commons' guidance](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) and their [license chooser tool](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) 
<p></p>

## FAIR and Metadata

What recurring feature in this unit that helped to implement FAIR Principles wasn't covered in the practice tasks? 

<mark>**Metadata**</mark>

Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing the FAIR principles in your research. In [unit 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata>) and [2.3](<2.3 Metadata in data lifecycle>) , we'll explore what metadata is and how it's used in research.
