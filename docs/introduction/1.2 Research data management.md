## Using research data

In the previous unit we looked at what research data is, now we'll look at what we do with it.

We use research data as evidence to confirm or reject our research hypotheses. In order to do this, data needs to be collected and analysed. This may be primary data (data we collect ourselves) or secondary data (data collected by others).

However, if we don't organise and manage our data, we might ...

- Not understand our data, as datasets are not labelled and abbreviations are not explained
- Lose data, as it's not securely saved and labelled
- Produce 'dirty' data that contains human errors and inconsistencies and therefore cannot be used in our research

If data our is unorganised or 'dirty', we limit our ability to analyse it and produce effective findings. 

Poorly managed research data doesn't just impact the person who originally created the data. It also affects other researchers after the project has finished. 

For example, take a look at this video<sup>1</sup>. It covers a scenario where one researcher would like to find out more about another researcher's project. However, it is not as straightfoward as it seems. What problems arise?

</a>

Reflecting on the video you just watched, as well as your own experience, what are some examples of poor research data management of published data?

??? info "**Examples of poor research data management**"

    - Data is not properly cited or linked in publications
    - Links to objects/resources are broken e.g. when you follow a link in a citation, the page no longer exists or cannot be reached
    - Limited context to understand the data
      - Limited information about the project, such as when it was conducted, where it was conducted, who collected the data, how and why
      - Limited information about what the dataset contains, such as what type of data was collected, what abbreviations mean
    - No contact details of a person / organisation who collected the data to ask further questions about the data
    - Data in unusable or only available in proprietary software
    - No information about the data sharing policy
    - Unclear data access process that doesn't specify how long it takes or the cost

## Poor research data management

### What is the impact of poor research data management?

For published research data, poor data management impacts the discovery, understandability and (re)use of that data. Again, reflecting on the video and your own experience, what are the consequences of this? 

??? warning "The reach and use of research data is limited"

    - Other people are less likely to trust and use your data if it is poorly managed as it is harder to understand and may contain errors and inconsistencies.</li>
    - If your data is hard to understand and/or trust, it is less likely that it will be cited in other projects or used in secondary research and cross-study comparisons. This limits its impact and, in the long run, this could affect your chances of getting future funding or support.</li>

??? warning "Research data is less secure"

    - If there is no clear data usage or sharing policies, your data could be misused.
    - If data is not stored in a secure location, it could be lost or accessed by people without permission. This is especially risky if your data is sensitive and needs to be kept secure.

??? warning "Time is wasted trying to understand data retrospectively"

    - You will have to spend more time trying to find and organise poorly managed data into a meaningful structure so it can be understood and used.
    - You may need to repeat a study to correct errors caused by poor data management, doubling the time and resources needed to obtain the data.
    - If your study is not documented and made discoverable, people might not know it exists and it could be unnecessarily duplicated by others.

??? warning "Access to future research funding could be impacted"

    - If data is poorly managed and/or inaccessible, institutions are less likely to fund future research.

_Poor data management causes inefficiency and devalues the quality and usability of your research. Poorly managed data affects both the person who has created the data and others who are interested in using the data._


>[!NOTE]
>HM - I prefer the consequences as I think the who is repetitive within itself and ties in with the later on sections. If it is decided to only keep one set, I would take some of the wording from the who to make the consequences more personal if possible i.e. you instead of people. <br>
> KR Have updated Consequences section and removed 'Who does this impact'


## Reseach data management

In order to avoid these problems, research data needs to be managed. This concept is called research data management (RDM).

What do do you think we mean by research data management?

??? quote "**Research data management definition**"

    MANTRA defines research data management as...

    _'Research data management (RDM) is about handling research data effectively and appropriately throughout the life of a research project and beyond. Research data management refers to all aspects of creating, storing, sharing and archiving data and is an essential aspect of conducting responsible research'<sup>[2]</sup></i>_

    You can watch a short video created by the Office of Scholarly Communication, Cambridge on <a href="https://youtu.be/-xwC7R9Km1c">research data management here.</a><sup>[4]</sup>

**So, who's responsible for implementing good research data management?** 

Everyone involved in a research project is responsible for implementing good RDM. Larger projects may assign different roles and share out RDM responsibilities. People outisde of the research project are also responsible for good RDM when they cite or re-use that data.

## How can we implement good research data management in our own research?

=== "Data Managment Plans"

    Data Management Plans (DMP) are a document that outline how a project will manage their data. This includes assigning roles in RDM, and specify where and how data will be stored and documented. It is advised that all research projects create at DMP at the begining of the project.<sup>[3]</sup>

    **What should a DMP include?**

    - DMPs should address the whole research lifecycle, covering how data will be collected, processed, analysed, described, preserved, and shared during the course of a research project and beyond. [We will look more closely at the research lifecycle in unit 2.2](<2.2 Metadata in data lifecycle.md>).
    - DMPs should be a living document that is updated as processes are refined and created when the need arises.
    - To find out more about DMPs, explore the resources listed [in this section](##-resources-for-developing-data-management-plans).
=== "FAIR Data principles"

    To help guide research data management across all discplines, the FAIR data principles were established as a hallmark of best practice that all projects should aim for. The principles help researchers avoid common problems that come from poor resarch data management and encourage data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR). We'll unpack these pricniples in the next [unit 1.3](<1.3 FAIR.md>).
=== "Structured documentation"

    By creating high quality documentation around research data, you can record key information that will help you organise data. For example, recording what different datasets contain and the security levels. You can also share this documentation with other researchers so they can understand your data without having to access to data files (note, this documentation does not need to contain any sensitive information). Metadata is a type of structured documentation that helps you to do this. We'll cover what metadata is and how it is used in research in [unit 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata.md>).

## RDM case studies and guidance

When thinking about how to implement good research data management for your project, it's useful to look at case studies, examples and guidance.

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) provide case studies of [good research data managment](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/case-studies) and [examples of DMPs with additional guidance](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/guidance-examples). Drawing from University case studies, [DCC also provide tips](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/RDM%20strategy%20development.pdf) on what to consider when you implement data management plans so they're not just a document that sits on your computer, but an active approach to your research.

Exploring these case studies and guidance, what do you think are the benefits of good research data management? How can do you think good research management can help the research process and data quality?

??? tip "Benefits of good research data management"

    **Efficiency**
    
    - Saves time and resources by establishing robust documentation, stoarge and preservation processes
    - Reduces the risk of losing data and ensures long-term preservation of data
    - Reduces the potential for research duplication
    - Improves internal communication and workflows within a project
 
    **Quality and trustworthiness of your data**
    
    - Enables other researchers to use your research and encourages cross-study research
    - Proof of transparent and valid research methods and data
    - Improves the accuracy and security of your data

    **Encourages re-use and makes your data go further**
    
    - Facilitates the re-use of data by yourself and others
    - It is required to obtain funding and/or meet funding bodies' requirements

## Assess your research data management approach

How strong is your research data management? 

Checklists can help you make sure you've considered all areas of research data management in your research. These are available online, for example ...

- Standford Medicine provide a [data management checklist](https://laneguides.stanford.edu/DataManagement/checklist) where you tick different RDM activities once you've completed them.
  - DDC provide a pdf [Research data management plan checklist](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf) that offers prompting questions.
  - Openaire gives a [checklist](https://www.openaire.eu/rdm-service-development-checklist) for different stakeholders in the research process: the research group, institution, repository, research infrastructure, funder and national. On each page, it outlines what each group should consider to carry out RDM.
  - The University of Leiden has created a [RDM checklist](https://www.library.universiteitleiden.nl/researchers/data-management/rdm-checklist#) broken down in the different stages of the research lifecycle, from data management planning to data archiving and publishing.

If you're currently working on a project, try using one of the lists above to assess your research data management approach.

## Test your knowledge

1. When in the research process should you create a data management plan?
2. What stage of the research lifecycle should a data management plan address?
3. Who should create a data management plan?
4. Who is responsible for carrying out a data management plan?

??? success "**Answers**"

    1. When in the research process should you create a data management plan?<br>
    - At the start of the project in the research design stage.
    
    2. What stage of the research lifecycle should a data management plan address?<br>
    - A data management plan (DMP) should address all stages of the research lifecycle, including after the research has finished.
    
    3. Who should create a data management plan?<br>
    - The lead researcher or research team, often with input from data managers or institutional support. If it is a large research team, you may delegate different areas of the DMP to be completed.
    
    4. Who is responsible for carrying out a data management plan?<br>
    - Everyone in the research team is responsible for carrying out the DMP. You may also assign specific tasks to relevant members.
