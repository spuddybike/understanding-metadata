## Who's this course for?

This course is for anyone who will be engaging with data or research in order to carry out their work. 

Some of the types of people we think this course could help are...
- Masters and PhD students
- Researchers 
- People working for funding bodies of academic research
- People working in policy areas that use data and academic research in their work

## What level of information do I need to know before starting the course?

You don't have to have any previous knowledge or training in metadata in order to do the Introduction course. As we will cover in the course, we use metadata in many areas of our lives already often without even realising it. So, even if this is the first time hearing the word, you have most likely engaged with metadata already.

You may already know about metadata and have done some training.

## How do I take the course?

The Introduction course is split into 10 units. These are...
- **1.1 Research data**  
- **1.2 Research data management**
- **1.3 FAIR**
- **2.1 Introduction to metadata**
- **2.3 Metadata in data lifecycle**
- **2.4 Controlled vocabularies**
- **2.5 Metadata standards**
- **2.6 Creating metadata: study level**
- **2.7 Using metadata: discover and understand data**

If this your first time engaging with metadata, we recommend working through the units chronologically so you can build on your understanding.

If you already have a strong understanding of metadata and are already working it in your research practice, you may only want to dip in and out of units to refresh your understanding or address any gaps in your current knowledge.

If you are already working with metadata or have completed training in metadata before, it's important to note that some terms may be used differently by people and/or disciplines. The way some concepts are defined in this course may also be different to how you currently understand them.

So we can give , we'll define key terms and concepts as we go along. You can refer to the definitions in the course glossary.


>[!NOTE]
> Should we include a glossary for the course?

- Who is this module for
  - Note on how people may have come across some of these terms already but there are many different interpretations of the same concept. Highlight how working through this course we will outline different concepts in the way that we understand them and build 
- How to do this course (e.g. in one sitting or come back to different modules)
- Overview of units and time expectations for each module
